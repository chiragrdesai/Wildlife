    is that unidentified zeal that nature from God did steal.Explore the the
    land, the sky and the sea and enjoy. Most of the adventure travelers aspire
    to reach out to the extremes. High waves and the obstruction sin the river,
    the determination to pass every hurdle makes a true adventurer. The quest to

    psychological tempest that moves with the whilpool of excitement.<br>

    everything on it from a height of 18,000 feet? Stroll from one palace to
    another riding a camel or perhaps get a better view of the jungle sitting
    smart on an elephant? Well if any of them is an affirmative, the adventure
    holidays are just for you. <br>

    multiplied when enjoyed riding an elephant, the Ganges is irresistible for
    the water sports and the scenic beauty of Jammu is picture perfect for the

    <b>TREKKING IN INDIA : DISCOVERING NATURE</b><br>
     <br>
     Trekking is not merely a mountain walk, rather it is an exploration of
    every thing that resides within the mountain range. It is a journey beyond
    the confines of nature and is also a rendezvous with the cultural diaspora
    that vibrates within the mountaneous range.<br>
     <br>
     Above all, it is a complete and unique experience which satisfies
    adventurous ambitions and provides inner fulfilment. Most people return from
    the Himalayas profoundly moved by this experience, but for some of us it
    completely changes our lives. The influence it exerts becomes irresistible
    and we find ourselves longing to make that annual pilgrimage to those most
    cherished mountains.<br>
     <br>
